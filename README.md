🧠 Unity AI NavMesh Learning Project

A beginner-friendly Unity project demonstrating AI navigation using Unity’s NavMesh system.
In this project, a simple rolling ball acts as a Player and A Cube act as an AI agent that navigates across the scene, avoids obstacles, and Chases the Player Automatically.

✨ Features
🎮 AI-Controlled Agent – A Cube with physics-based rolling behavior controlled via NavMeshAgent.
🗺️ Dynamic Navigation Mesh – Environment baked with NavMeshObjects for walkable areas.
🪙 Collectible Items – Player agent actively seeks and collects placed collectibles.
🚧 Obstacle Handling – Agent detects and avoids obstacles while moving to targets.
📚 Learning-Focused – A simple, clean project to understand how Unity NavMesh AI works.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Engine: Unity (2021.3 LTS or later recommended)
Language: C#
