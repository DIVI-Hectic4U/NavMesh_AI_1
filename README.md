🧠 Unity AI NavMesh Learning Project

A beginner-friendly Unity project demonstrating AI navigation using Unity’s NavMesh system.
In this project:
A rolling ball acts as the Player, collecting items in the scene.
A Cube acts as the AI Agent, which navigates using NavMesh, avoids obstacles, and chases the Player automatically.


✨ Features
🎮 AI-Controlled Agent – A cube controlled via NavMeshAgent to chase the player.
🗺️ Dynamic Navigation Mesh – Environment baked with NavMeshObjects for walkable areas.
🪙 Collectible Items – The player ball actively seeks and collects collectibles.
🚧 Obstacle Handling – AI agent detects and avoids obstacles while moving.
📚 Learning-Focused – A clean project to understand how Unity NavMesh AI works.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Engine: Unity (2021.3 LTS or later recommended)
